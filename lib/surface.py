"""
This module contains functions for generating the parameters that describe
the surface BRDF, the bottom boundary condition used in solver.RTE (SHDOM).
Rather than reading the surface parameters from a file as in SHDOM, they are
directly generated and are formatted by a fortran subroutine pyshdom.core.prep_surface
which is a minor modification of shdomsub3.f READ_SURFACE.

Each of these surfaces have corresponding fortran subroutines which evaluate
the BRDF based on the prescribed parameters.
Implementing a new surface would require writing a new subroutine that evaluates
the BRDF to shdomsub2.f (model after RPV_REFLECTION). Then add a block to
SURFACE_BRDF in shdomsub2.f that calls this model, and pyshdom.core.prep_surface
(PREP_SURFACE in surface.f) that prepares the input parameters. Additionally,
a python wrapper should be added here, and the chosen `sfctype` should be added
to the list of valid surface types in solver.RTE._setup_surface.

The spatially varying surface parameters are defined using a linear interpolation
kernel on a uniformly spaced grid in each of the 'x' and 'y' directions. This surface
grid does not have to correspond with the grid used to define the volumetric
optical properties in solver.RTE. Linear interpolation will be used to map from
the surface grid to solver.RTE grid within SHDOM.

    Parameters
    ----------
    surface_type : string
        The type of the surface to be generated.
    ground_temperature : float or np.ndarray
        The array of surface blackbody emission temperatures.
    delx : float
        The 'x' spacing of gridpoints in variable surfaces in units of [km].
    dely : float
        The 'y' spacing of gridpoints in variable surfaces in units of [km].
    kwargs : np.ndarray
        Each entry in kwargs should be a parameter describing the surface
        (other than `ground_temperature`). Note that the order of these is
        significant. See the use of this function within surface.py for
        examples.

    Returns
    -------
    surface_dataset : xr.Dataset
        The dataset contains the parameters for the surface along with the correct
        flags for use by solver.RTE (SHDOM).

    Notes
    -----
    There are no checks performed to make sure that the correct kwargs for each
    surface type are passed, or that they are in the correct order. For this reason,
    do not use this function in isolation.
