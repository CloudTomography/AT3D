# pyshdom

Pyshdom performs 3D reconstruction of cloud microphysical properties from multi-angle, multi-spectral solar reflected radiation using a non-linear optimization procedure [[1],[2]]. The core radiative transfer routines are sourced from the Fortran SHDOM (Spherical Harmonic Discrete Ordinate Method for 3D Atmospheric Radiative Transfer) code by Frank K. Evans [[3]]. The python package was created by Aviad Levis, Amit Aides (Technion - Israel Institute of Technology) and Jesse Loveridge (University of Illinois).

## Features

At present pyshdom has the following features:

* Mie & Rayleigh scattering optical property calculations. Optical properties of other species (e.g. non-spherical ice or aerosol) can be included but must be calculated externally.
* Cloud data of varying complexity can be generated or read from LES output.
* Scalar radiative transfer from SHDOM with Perspective or Orthographic sensor geometries and Lambertian Surface.
* Each SHDOM solution is serial but independent wavelengths and pixel radiance calculations are
parallelised in a shared memory framework.
* Local & Global optimization procedures for recovery of cloud microphysical properties (liquid water content,
droplet effective radius, droplet effective variance) on 3D (or reduced order) grids from simulated (or observed) radiances.
* The calculation of optical properties and each SHDOM solution have been streamlined to minimize computational resources
necessary at each iteration of the optimization routines.

Future Improvements:

* Implement vector SHDOM to include polarisation information in the optimization.
* Add additional sensor geometries (cross-track scan, push-broom) & expand to other surface types in SHDOM.
* Include a more flexible parallelisation scheme.
* Add useful regularisation options in the optimization procedure.
* Add further accelerations for computational efficiency.
* Include gaseous absorption for greater realism.

## Updates in pyshdom3.0
 - Code migration to python3
 - Multispectral rendering and optimization
 - Microphysical optimization
 - Single scattering derivatives are exact (along broken ray paths)
 - Main changes to SHDOM core Fortran code: 
     1. Removal of global variables (property array)
     2. Particle mixing is done at runtime and not as an a-priori computation 
     4. Mie computations are broken down to mono-disperse and poly-disperse
